# RFC #219: Add Support for WebExtensions in WPT

## Summary

The WebExtensions API extends the capabilities of the browser. Adding support for WebExtensions in the web-platform-tests will increase interoperability and help drive the standardization of this API.

This RFC proposes adding a new `testharness.js` wrapper type, `.extension.js`, to handle testing this API, in addition to using `testdriver.js` to load and unload extensions. A new `feature=extensions` was also introduced to support enabling `BiDi` specifically for user agents that use it for the web-platform-tests. This feature can be removed once all browser vendors use `BiDi` for these tests.

## Details

Using `testdriver.js`, we added support for testing the WebExtensions API by loading a web extension designed to test the functionality of a specific API.

These tests won't leverage `testharness.js` directly since most of the test execution is handled within the extension via the `browser.test` API. We’ve elected to use this API since all participating browser vendors use `browser.test` internally and can easily port over existing tests to the web-platform-tests.

Tests are driven from a web page like a usual wpt test. These web pages have access to a minimal `browser.test` API consisting of the `browser.test.onMessage.addListener` method, which allows the test to receive extension test progress notifications from the user agent. It is up to the user agent to send the messages "test-started" and "test-finished", respectively. These messages should be sent when a test that was passed into `browser.test.runTests` (in the extension) has started and finished. In addition, when recording the result for a `browser.test.assert...()` method, it is up to the user agent to send the messages "assert" or "assert-equality".

Because these tests don’t leverage `testharness.js` directly, we’ve introduced a new wrapper type, `.extension.js`, that will create the necessary boilerplate to convert these messages into the corresponding assertions in `testharness.js`.

A browser instance should not run multiple `.extension.js` tests in parallel. Because browser extensions can modify and observe the state of the full browser, parallel execution would result in unexpected test failures. A browser instance may be reused by sequential executions of `.extension.js` if the test or user agent ensures that any significant state is cleared between test runs.

It's important to note that it isn't guaranteed that the web page will load before the extension loads. This means a race condition could occur that would cause the `browser.test` assertion results to not be reported back to the test harness, since the `browser.test.onMessage` listener wasn't registered. To resolve this, user agents would need to queue the results until a listener is registered and then report them.

Lastly, since the `Classic` and `BiDi` implementations support loading an extension using a `path` or `archivePath` to the extension's resources, the full path to the extension's resources is formulated by using the `test.path` before the protocol loads the extension.

A proposed patch is available at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/50648.

## `browser.test` API

The `browser.test` API provides utilities for writing and running tests for WebExtensions. It includes assertion functions and a test harness to facilitate structured and reliable testing.

### Methods

**`browser.test.assertTrue(condition, message)`**  
Asserts that a given condition is `true`. If the condition is `false`, the test fails.

**Parameters**

* `condition` (boolean) – The condition to assert. If `false`, the test fails.
* `message` (string, optional) – A message describing the assertion.

**`browser.test.assertFalse(condition, message)`**  
Asserts that a given condition is `false`. If the condition is `true`, the test fails.

**Parameters**

* `condition` (boolean) – The condition to assert. If `true`, the test fails.
* `message` (string, optional) – A message describing the assertion.

**`browser.test.assertEq(actual, expected, message)`**
Throws an assertion error and fails the test if the actual value is not _logically_ equal to the expected value, by these rules:

1) _Plain arrays_ (`Array.isArray()` returns true) are compared for _deep_ equality.
    1.1) Their `length` and all items are recursively compared by these same rules.
2) _Plain objects_ (with prototype `Object.prototype` or `null`) are also compared recursively.
    2.1) Only enumerable _own_ properties are considered, unordered.
3) Everything else is compared using `Object.is()` [same value algorithm](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-samevalue).

We're starting with support for the minimal set of compound types, and plan to expand custom rules to include `ArrayBuffer`s, `Map`s, `Set`s, etc. in congruence with Node's [assert.deepStrictEqual()](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#comparison-details_1).

**Parameters**

* `actual` (any) – The actual value.
* `expected` (any) – The expected value.
* `message` (string, optional) – A message describing the assertion.

**`browser.test.assertThrows(fn, expectedError, message)`**
Asserts that a given function throws an error when executed. If the function does not throw, the test fails. The test will also fail if `expectedError` is defined and the function does not throw an error with a message matching `expectedError`.

When `assertThrows` is invoked with two parameters, the second value should be interpreted as `expectedError`. This is explicitly mentioned because `expectedError` and `message` are both optional and accepting string values.

**Parameters**

* `fn` (function) – A function expected to throw an error.
* `expectedError` (any, optional) – A string (which must match exactly) or a RegExp stating the expected error.
* `message` (string, optional) – A message describing the assertion.

**`browser.test.runTests(tests)`**
Queues an array of individual test functions to run, executes them serially, and returns a promise. The promise is rejected if one of the tests fails; otherwise, it resolves. A test will fail if an assertion fails or if an unexpected error is thrown. All test functions passed into the array will run, even if a previous test failed.  After the returned promise is settled, the method can be called again to run additional tests. Calling it while test are still running throws or returns a rejected promise.

**Parameters**

* `tests` (array) – An array of functions.

**`browser.test.onMessage.addListener(listener)`**
Event for receiving messages sent to the test harness by the browser.

**Parameters**

* `listener` (function) – A function that gets called when a message is received.

**Listener Parameters**

* `message` (string) – A message notifying the test harness that an event has occurred (e.g. "test-started").
* `data` (object) – An object containing information about the test(s).

Messages the browser agents can send to the test harness, and the expected data parameters:

**"test-started" `data` parameters**

* `testName` (string) – The name of the test being run.

**"test-finished" `data` parameters**

* `testName` (string) – The name of the test that ran.
* `result` (boolean) – A boolean indicating whether the test passed or failed.
* `remainingTests` (number) – The number of remaining tests to run.
* `message` (string, optional) – A message to describe an error if the test failed.

**"assert" `data` parameters**

* `result` (boolean) – A boolean indicating whether the test assertion passed or failed.
* `message` (object) – A message describing the assertion.

**"assert-equality" `data` parameters**

* `result` (boolean) – A boolean indicating whether the test assertion passed or failed.
* `assertionDescription` (string) – A human-readable description, such as "Assertion Failed: Expected: 'string'; Actual: 'function'".
* `message` (string) (optional) – An additional message provided by the test assertion.

## Alternatives Considered

We considered loading the extension statically before each `testharness.js` test is run, but we decided against that since `testdriver.js` allows the tests to drive the browser, and in the future, test functionality such as opening popups and clicking menu items.

We considered adding a new test type rather than using JavaScript tests, but we decided against it because it involved significantly more work compared to using `testharness.js`.

Lastly, since Chrome uses the `BiDi` implementation, we considered using the existing `feature=bidi` flag to enable `BiDi` for the tests. However, since not all browser vendors support `BiDi`, using this flag could be problematic, as this feature would be enabled for tests that wouldn't always need `BiDi` enabled. To resolve this, a new `feature=extensions` was added, which as of now, enables `BiDi` for Chrome.

## Risks

There are two potential concerns with this implementation:

1. We have no precedent for tests run via a Classic command in some user agents and a BiDi command in others. However, the Classic implementation of loading and unloading extensions is modeled on the BiDi implementation, so we expect the behavior to be the same. The Classic implementation is defined in the [WECG](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/specification/webdriver-classic.bs), and the BiDi implementation is defined in [WebDriver BiDi](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver-bidi/#module-webExtension).

2. Another concern could be with using `browser.test` assertions and mapping them to `testharness.js` assertions. Since `testharness.js` isn't in charge of generating assertions, we might end up with less useful failure messages.
